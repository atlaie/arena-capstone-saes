          "fe94cbb01cb694a49bc61056f3b601b4": "Meiosis occurs in the ** testes (in males) and the ovaries (in females)**. \n\nHere's a more detailed explanation:\n\n* **Testis:** In males, the primary function of the testes is to produce sperm cells (spermatocytes). These cells undergo meiosis to produce sperm, which are haploid sex cells with half the number of chromosomes as a somatic cell. \n* **Ovary:** In females, the ovaries are responsible for producing egg cells (oocytes). Like sperm, these are haploid cells, and meiosis is crucial for creating a mature egg for fertilization and ultimately, the formation of a zygote. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! \n"
