Here's why:\n\n**Understanding the Basic Principles**\n\n* **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** Planets, like all spinning objects, are governed by the second law of motion, which states that a body's angular momentum (a measure of the object's tendency to keep spinning) is conserved in any situation where no external torque acts on it. This is especially true in the case of planets, as they typically don't experience significant mass or energy loss.\n* **Centrifugal Force:** The outward force experienced by an object as it rotates because of its own motion is called centrifugal force. It acts outwards and increases as the object spins faster.\n* **Torque and the Coriolis Effect:** A force applied across an object's surface can cause it to accelerate, changing its rate of rotation. This is related to the concept of torque applied to the object by the force acting on its surface. The Coriolis effect, an integral part of rotating frames of reference,  is related to the relationship between linear and angular velocities, describing the apparent deflection of moving objects and wind currents in rotating gravitational fields such as those around Earth and the Sun. \n\n**The Impact Scenario**\n\n1. **Initial State:** The planet has a certain angular momentum based on its mass distribution and initial rotation speed.\n2. **Impact:** The impact pushes debris outward, generating torque. One way the impact increases torque might be by converting kinetic energy from the meteorite's impact into an external torque that rotates the planet.\n3. **Increased Angular Momentum:** The outward push causes a net torque, resulting in an increase in the planet's angular momentum. \n4. **Rotation Adjustment:** This increases rotational speed, as the angular momentum is not only a function of mass, but also of the amount of \"spin\" or angular momentum, often requiring a time to adjust to the new rotational velocity.\n\n\n**Impact on Planet Shape**\n\nThe planet's shape, however, is not as simple as a completely sudden change in spin. The shape, especially its bulge, will be affected by the amount of angular momentum transfer associated with the impact. As the planet's angular momentum becomes different compared to the object’s original state, it causes a re-adjustment, likely resulting in a somewhat longer, and more significant bulge to the planet's equator as it adjusts to the increased angular momentum. \n\n\nLet me know if you'd like a deeper dive into any specific aspect or related concepts like planetary evolution and gravitational interaction. \n",

Specifically, how the car's speed (initial velocity) determines how high it can jump when traveling over a ramp.\n* **Trial structure:**  He is testing the effect by altering the car's speed, which he's doing by increasing it by a consistent factor (20 mph) in each trial. \n* **Key variables:** The trial results will show how the car's height (how high it jumps) changes depending on the car's speed.\n\nThis type of experiment is a classic example of analyzing variables and their influence on a system's behaviour. \n"
